A.Auto Events Blog Fontend:

Technologies used:
-React, Bootstrap and Sass

About this project:

-I created this app for car enthusiasts to be able to blog their experience of an auto show. I also wanted to show product availability.
-On the main page of this app, you are able to have the option to be directed to two other pages: Blog and Store.
-When clicking on the "Blog" you are directed to the blog page which has a form for you to enter in the: Date, Event Name, Event location, Topic and Text. Clicking submit allows your post to drop down into a card for others to see. On the card you are able to edit the post by clicking "edit" allowing a modal to pop up with the fields to edit. Having the option to save or delete your post, the modal will then close.
-When clicking on the "store", merchanise will appear. The administrator is allowed to enter this information from the backend. There are cards that show: Vendor, Item, Description, Price, Catergory, and Image.

Struggles:
-I ended up having to make the decision to not add in a few models that i created from the backend due to timing. I had created a car model that has a model within to choose options. This is something i would like to go back and add.
-I would like to have added user authentication for this project.
